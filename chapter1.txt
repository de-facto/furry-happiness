Where would we humans be without our pets. They are remarkable for their inconditional love, intelligence, fun-loving nature, loyalty and best of all, they are a bundle of furry happiness. As if that wasn't enough, our pets are capable of extraordinary feats (when trained well), can be very protective and compassionate. Now all this may sound as though our pets are anthropomorphised, particularly when we give them names, but our pets are, in fact, better versions of what we expect of ourselves.
